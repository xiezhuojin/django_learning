## BaseDateDetailView(YearMixin, MonthMixin, DayMixin, DateMixin, BaseDetailView)

## _date_from_string
* get a datetime.date object given a format string and a year, month, and day (only year is mandatory). Raise a 404 for an invalid date.
## _get_next_prev
* get the next or the previous valid date. The idea is to allow links on month/day views to never by 404s by never providing a date that'll be invalid for the given view.

## timezone_today
* return the current day in the current time zone.
